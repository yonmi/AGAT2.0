# AGAT2.0

Work on progress on a tool gathering some useful libraries in the field of image processing especially in hierarchical segmentation. 

Take a look at the 3 projects linked below in order to have an idea on what will be gathered in this library.

&bull; [BPT](https://github.com/yonmi/BinaryPartitionTree/blob/master/src/standard/sequential/BPT.java):</b> Binary Partition Tree </br>
&bull; [MBPT](https://github.com/yonmi/BinaryPartitionTree/blob/master/src/multi/sequential/MBPT.java):</b> Multi-feature Binary Partition Tree

<b>Language:</b> Java </br>
<b>Purpose:</b> Gathering libraries helping to create and to evaluate hierarchical structures such as BPT and MBPT </br>

<b>Project dependencies:</b> </br>
